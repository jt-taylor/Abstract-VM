The goal of this Project is to make a very basic asembly language interpreter
the `language' used for this project is described further in the project pdf
but for a simple explanation
	- comments start with ';'
	- push to stack int_8 int_16 int_32 float or double
	- pop
	- dump ; print the contents of the stack
	- assert ; asserts that the head of the stack is equal to the this paramater
				else thow an exception
	- add
	- sub
	- mul
	- div
	- mod
	- print ; assert that the head of stack is int_8 and prints it char value
	- exit ; if not present throw an error

am going to  try to use the c++ library lexertk under the MIT liscence
